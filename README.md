# CEAPS Data Science Project

## Introduction

This repository is a Data Science project to analyze data about the expanses that Brazilian senators declared, divided by year, available on [CEAPS](https://www12.senado.leg.br/transparencia/dados-abertos-transparencia/dados-abertos-ceaps?utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9oraJDtmhd8_VnMw6lGWYoF-FANWSpngMwRtg5ovo9-FUTm4kwZNmhdv-VODztf3mjAuiwU6VMgVCFd_3ndX_vSNKFpg&_hsmi=231298145&utm_content=231298145&utm_source=hs_automation) (Cota para Exerc√≠cio da Atividade Parlamentar dos Senadores).
